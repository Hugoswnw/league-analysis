Jupyter notebooks about data querying and analysis in league of legends competitions.

## Articles
This repository is part of a project of blog articles. 
You can find the first one here : https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-as-support-of-esports-performance-and-strategies-i-d511843b00a1. A markdown print of the notebook is also available here https://github.com/Hugoswnw/league-analysis/blob/master/analysis/OverviewWC/OverviewWC.md.

## Data
I am not sharing either database dumps or oracle's elixir files.
You can download Match Data Files here https://oracleselixir.com/match-data/.

## Database
If you want to load Riot API through this project, you should have a MySQL database instanciated with CreateDatabase.sql and valid connection informations stored in safe_connection.json at root. You should reuse db_connector.example.json.
